title: "Update: Last Parsing of the Spec Done!"

This is a major update. This is basically (hopefully) the last time we parsed the specification. There were a few bugs in the previous parsing which led to some missing pages because they were overwritten when multiple dictionary items shared the same name.

With this parsing, I fixed a bunch of other issues, so hopefully this will be the last parsing update, and from here on out it will just be manual updates to this project.

So this makes it version 2.0 beta is out!

Additionally, the glossary has been parsed again, and improved dramatically, so that the tooltips should now show, and have proper html rendering.
