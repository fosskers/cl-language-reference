## Definitions Tooltip

I made a react component tooltip for definitions to show you the definition of a term in place instead of a having to navigate to the glossary page. In addition, the same tooltip will link to the proper dictionary item if it exists, and if not, to the glossary page of the term. We still need to add the component all around, but this should make the functionality of the page much better. Here's an example: [See the "forms" word in section 6.1.1.1 of Loops](/docs/chap-6/g-b-the-loop-facility)

## What Alpha version means

- Now we are finally open to contributions of examples and added explanation
  - Contribution stubs were added at the end of Dictionary Items type pages see for example [progn](https://lisp-docs.github.io/cl-language-reference/docs/chap-5/f-d-dictionary/progn#expanded-reference-progn)
- The main text is unlikely to change much except for:
  - Minor formatting issues
  - Maybe there are still some symbols that are not rendering properly
  - Code Blocks for syntax highlighting in the non dictionary type pages have not yet been added
  - Tables have to be formatted
- Therefore we are open to other contributions that are more meaningful in terms of content and development, please see our [To Do Page](/todo) for how you can contribute!
