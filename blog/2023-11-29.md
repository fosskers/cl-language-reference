## Code Blocks

The current status is that for some reason replacing the code with lisp formatted code blocks was failing due to regex issues. 

Here are the lisp highlighted code blocks. **Edit:** removed link.

If you find any code that is not highlighted, please find the appropiate code block and replace it in the code!
