Finally, I can announe that the **beta version** is out!

This is what I updated since last time:

- Parsed again all the specification to account for missing/overwritten pages because of similarly named items.
- Added glossary definition tooltips everywhere I could (programatically, we can add more by hand by identifying any place missing a definition).
- Added all the links of "See Also" and any time something is referenced in the text of the specification, the link for that item should now be working.
- Added a lot of code blocks for example sections to provide syntax highlighting. Not all of the code in the reference is inside a code block, but most of them are. The rest most be parsed manually.

Enjoy!
