## Finally, we are at Alpha, version 1.0 is out!

As of today, 2023/12/06 the Alpha version of the technical reference is out.

These are a few of the improvements since last time:

- Complete Specification Update: There were parts of the spec missing because of an issue of files getting truncated before they were converted into markdown. I have now recovered the truncated parts, parsed them, and added them to the specification
- A large amount of code now shows up in code blocks with syntax highlighting.
- A lot of symbols like `→`, `≡`, and a few others are now properly displayed
- The Index, Figures, and Credits were parsed to be displayed properly per the original
- The search index was updated to account for the new content
- A bunch of formatting issues for the markdown to be displayed properly

## What Alpha version means

- Now we are finally open to contributions of examples and added explanation
  - Contribution stubs were added at the end of Dictionary Items type pages see for example [progn](https://lisp-docs.github.io/cl-language-reference/docs/chap-5/f-d-dictionary/progn#expanded-reference-progn)
- The main text is unlikely to change much except for:
  - Minor formatting issues
  - Maybe there are still some symbols that are not rendering properly
  - Code Blocks for syntax highlighting in the non dictionary type pages have not yet been added
  - Tables have to be formatted
- Therefore we are open to other contributions that are more meaningful in terms of content and development, please see our [To Do Page](/docs/contribute/todo) for how you can contribute!
