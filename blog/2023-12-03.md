## Dicionary Sections

As of now, 2023/12/03, all the dicionary pages have been broken up into their particular directories with a page per entry.

However there are still a few that need to be manually fixed because of problems with parsing the text with regex for certain exceptions.

Nevertheless, this improves the search results dramatically! The reference should now be much easier to use!

I also added a [Dicionary Item's To Do Page](/docs/contribute/dictionary-todo) for adding specific examples.

Cheers!
