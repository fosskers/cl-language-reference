 



In data-directed destructuring, the pattern is a sample <GlossaryTerm  term={"object"}><i>object</i></GlossaryTerm> of the <GlossaryTerm  term={"type"}><i>type</i></GlossaryTerm> to be decomposed. Wherever a component is to be extracted, a <GlossaryTerm  term={"symbol"}><i>symbol</i></GlossaryTerm> appears in the pattern; this <GlossaryTerm  term={"symbol"}><i>symbol</i></GlossaryTerm> is the name of the variable whose value will be that component.
