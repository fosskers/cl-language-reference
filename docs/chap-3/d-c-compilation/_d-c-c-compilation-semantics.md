 



Conceptually, compilation is a process that traverses code, performs certain kinds of syntactic and semantic analyses using information (such as proclamations and <ClLinks styled={true} term={"macro"}><i>macro</i></ClLinks> definitions) present in the *compilation environment*, and produces equivalent, possibly more efficient code.
