 



Of the <ClLinks  term={"type"}><i>types</i></ClLinks> over which <ClLinks  term={"similarity"}><i>similarity</i></ClLinks> is defined, some are treated as aggregate objects. For these types, <ClLinks  term={"similarity"}><i>similarity</i></ClLinks> is defined recursively. We say that an <ClLinks  term={"object"}><i>object</i></ClLinks> of these types has certain “basic qualities” and to satisfy the <ClLinks  term={"similarity"}><i>similarity</i></ClLinks> relationship, the values of the corresponding qualities of the two <ClLinks  term={"object"}><i>objects</i></ClLinks> must also be similar.
