 



Of the <GlossaryTerm  term={"type"}><i>types</i></GlossaryTerm> over which <GlossaryTerm  term={"similarity"}><i>similarity</i></GlossaryTerm> is defined, some are treated as aggregate objects. For these types, <GlossaryTerm  term={"similarity"}><i>similarity</i></GlossaryTerm> is defined recursively. We say that an <GlossaryTerm  term={"object"}><i>object</i></GlossaryTerm> of these types has certain “basic qualities” and to satisfy the <GlossaryTerm  term={"similarity"}><i>similarity</i></GlossaryTerm> relationship, the values of the corresponding qualities of the two <GlossaryTerm  term={"object"}><i>objects</i></GlossaryTerm> must also be similar.
