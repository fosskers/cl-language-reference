## Expanded Reference: function

The last paragraph of the description implies that if <DictionaryLink  term={"function"}><b>function</b></DictionaryLink> is used on a *function name* that does not denote a <GlossaryTerm  term={"function"}><i>function</i></GlossaryTerm> in the lexical environment in which the <DictionaryLink  term={"function"}><b>function</b></DictionaryLink> form appears, then the semantics are not specified, so the consequences of this use are undefined.
