 



A *conforming implementation* shall be accompanied by a document that provides a definition of all <ClLinks styled={true} term={"implementation-defined"}><i>implementation-defined</i></ClLinks> aspects of the language defined by this specification. 



In addition, a *conforming implementation* is encouraged (but not required) to document items in this standard that are identified as <ClLinks styled={true} term={"implementation-dependent"}><i>implementation-dependent</i></ClLinks>, although in some cases such documentation might simply identify the item as “undefined.”
