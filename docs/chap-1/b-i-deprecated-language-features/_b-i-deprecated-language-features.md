 



Deprecated language features are not expected to appear in future Common Lisp standards, but are required to be implemented for conformance with this standard; see Section 1.5.1.1 (Required Language Features). 



<GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"conforming program"}><i>Conforming programs</i></GlossaryTerm> can use deprecated features; however, it is considered good programming style to avoid them. It is permissible for the compiler to produce <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"style warning"}><i>style warnings</i></GlossaryTerm> about the use of such features at compile time, but there should be no such warnings at program execution time.
