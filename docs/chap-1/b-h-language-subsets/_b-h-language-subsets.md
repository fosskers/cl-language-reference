 



The language described in this standard contains no subsets, though subsets are not forbidden. 



For a language to be considered a subset, it must have the property that any valid <ClLinks styled={true} term={"program"}><i>program</i></ClLinks> in that language has equivalent semantics and will run directly (with no extralingual pre-processing, and no special compatibility packages) in any <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"conforming implementation"}><i>conforming implementation</i></GlossaryTerm> of the full language. 



A language that conforms to this requirement shall be described as being a “subset of Common Lisp as specified by ANSI ⟨standard number ⟩.”
