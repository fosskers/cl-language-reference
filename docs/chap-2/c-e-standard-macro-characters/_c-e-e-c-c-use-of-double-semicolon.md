 



Comments that begin with a double <GlossaryTerm  term={"semicolon"}><i>semicolon</i></GlossaryTerm> are all aligned to the same level of indentation as a <GlossaryTerm  term={"form"}><i>form</i></GlossaryTerm> would be at that same position in the <GlossaryTerm  term={"code"}><i>code</i></GlossaryTerm>. The text of such a comment usually describes the state of the <GlossaryTerm  term={"program"}><i>program</i></GlossaryTerm> at the point where the comment occurs, the <GlossaryTerm  term={"code"}><i>code</i></GlossaryTerm> which follows the comment, or both.
