 



Comments that begin with a double <ClLinks  term={"semicolon"}><i>semicolon</i></ClLinks> are all aligned to the same level of indentation as a <ClLinks  term={"form"}><i>form</i></ClLinks> would be at that same position in the <ClLinks  term={"code"}><i>code</i></ClLinks>. The text of such a comment usually describes the state of the <ClLinks  term={"program"}><i>program</i></ClLinks> at the point where the comment occurs, the <ClLinks  term={"code"}><i>code</i></ClLinks> which follows the comment, or both.
