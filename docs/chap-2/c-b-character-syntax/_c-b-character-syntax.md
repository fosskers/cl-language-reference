 



The *Lisp reader* takes <ClLinks  term={"character"}><i>characters</i></ClLinks> from a <ClLinks  term={"stream"}><i>stream</i></ClLinks>, interprets them as a printed representation of an <ClLinks  term={"object"}><i>object</i></ClLinks>, constructs that <ClLinks  term={"object"}><i>object</i></ClLinks>, and returns it. 



The syntax described by this chapter is called the *standard syntax*. Operations are provided by Common Lisp so that various aspects of the syntax information represented by a <ClLinks  term={"readtable"}><i>readtable</i></ClLinks> can be modified under program control; see Chapter 23 (Reader). Except as explicitly stated otherwise, the syntax used throughout this document is *standard syntax* .
