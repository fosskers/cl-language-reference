 



In a *hash table*, any visible change to the count of entries in the *hash table*, to the keys, or to the values associated with the keys is considered a visible modification with regard to <ClLinks  term={"equalp"}><b>equalp</b></ClLinks>. 



Note that the visibility of modifications to the keys depends on the equivalence test of the *hash table*, not on the specification of <ClLinks  term={"equalp"}><b>equalp</b></ClLinks>.
