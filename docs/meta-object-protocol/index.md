# Meta Object Protocol Introduction

:::tip
TODO: need to write an introduction to the MOP and other information important for the technical reference which is not part of the free chapters available
:::

## TODO Ideas

For a tutorial in lisp-docs (not this repository) or examples here, maybe convert this blog to markdown and post it here: https://web.archive.org/web/20230320194142/https://hyperthings.garden/posts/2021-06-25/playing-the-slots-with-mop.html

And here are a few more CLOS MOP posts: https://web.archive.org/web/20230320180852/https://hyperthings.garden/posts/series/clos-encounters.html

These can help as a general idea of what to add if they prove any good...
