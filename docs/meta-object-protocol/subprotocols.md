Subprotocols
------------

This section provides an overview of the Metaobject Protocols. The detailed behavior of each function, generic function and macro in the Metaobject Protocol is presented in [Chapter 6](chapter-6.md) . The remainder of this chapter is intended to emphasize connections among the parts of the Metaobject Protocol, and to provide some examples of the kinds of specializations and extensions the protocols are designed to support.
