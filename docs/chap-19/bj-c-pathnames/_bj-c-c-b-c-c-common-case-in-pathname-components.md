 



For the functions in Figure 19–2, a value of :common for the :case argument that these <GlossaryTerm  term={"function"}><i>functions</i></GlossaryTerm> should receive and yield <GlossaryTerm  term={"string"}><i>strings</i></GlossaryTerm> in component values according to the following conventions: 



*•* All <GlossaryTerm  term={"uppercase"}><i>uppercase</i></GlossaryTerm> means to use a file system’s customary <GlossaryTerm  term={"case"}><i>case</i></GlossaryTerm>. 



*•* All <GlossaryTerm  term={"lowercase"}><i>lowercase</i></GlossaryTerm> means to use the opposite of the customary <GlossaryTerm  term={"case"}><i>case</i></GlossaryTerm>. 



*•* Mixed <GlossaryTerm  term={"case"}><i>case</i></GlossaryTerm> represents itself. 



Note that these conventions have been chosen in such a way that translation from :local to :common and back to :local is information-preserving.
