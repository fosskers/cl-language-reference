 



Corresponds to the “version number” concept in many host file systems. 



The version is either a positive *integer* or a <ClLinks  term={"symbol"}><i>symbol</i></ClLinks> from the following list: <DictionaryLink  term={"nil"}><b>nil</b></DictionaryLink>, :wild, :unspecific, or :newest (refers to the largest version number that already exists in the file system when reading a file, or to a version number greater than any already existing in the file system when writing a new file). Implementations can define other special version <ClLinks  term={"symbol"}><i>symbols</i></ClLinks>.
