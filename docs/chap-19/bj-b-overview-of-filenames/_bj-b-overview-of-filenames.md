 



There are many kinds of <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"file system"}><i>file systems</i></GlossaryTerm>, varying widely both in their superficial syntactic details, and in their underlying power and structure. The facilities provided by Common Lisp for referring to and manipulating <ClLinks  term={"file"}><i>files</i></ClLinks> has been chosen to be compatible with many kinds of <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"file system"}><i>file systems</i></GlossaryTerm>, while at the same time minimizing the program-visible differences between kinds of <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"file system"}><i>file systems</i></GlossaryTerm>. 



Since <GlossaryTerm styled={true} term={"file system"}><i>file systems</i></GlossaryTerm> vary in their conventions for naming <ClLinks  term={"file"}><i>files</i></ClLinks>, there are two distinct ways to represent <ClLinks  term={"filename"}><i>filenames</i></ClLinks>: as <ClLinks  term={"namestring"}><i>namestrings</i></ClLinks> and as <ClLinks  term={"pathname"}><i>pathnames</i></ClLinks>.
