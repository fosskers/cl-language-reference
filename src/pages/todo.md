# Todo

Here we will list all the To Do items we have for this project, and you can help by taking care of any of them :D.

- All the *Dictionary* Sections have to be separated in the docs. For example, all of section 9.2 in the original is included in our [9.1](/docs/chap-9/j-b-condition-system-concepts). We need to split that file into two. Similarly for chapters
  - 3.8
  - 4.4
  - 5.3
  - 6.2
  - 7.7
  - 8.1?
  - 9.2
  - etc. It seems the last section of every chapter which is the *Dictionary* was bundled into the next to last section.
- Update all the code blocks to be formated with markdown. We have made some available [here](/docs/code-blocks), but please note that there may be characters or TeX terms that need to be changed to regular text. Markdown supports math formulas and special text, checkout the [Markdown Syntax](https://commonmark.org/help/) tutorial for how to do it. Note that we use [MDX](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features) instead of vanilla markdown.
- We need to format al the Tables to markdown.
